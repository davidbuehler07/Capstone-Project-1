# Where this data comes from

This data comes from the raw data being processed through the data wrangling notebook in the code folder. The raw data, even compressed, was too large to add to GitHub. If you would like to run through this beginning to end, go to ![this Kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction/data) to download the train_V2.csv file for the raw data used for this project.
